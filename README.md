Loan default occurs when a borrower fails to pay back a debt according to the initial arrangement. In the case of most consumer loans, this means that successive payments have been missed over the course of weeks or months. Fortunately, lenders and loan servicers usually allow a grace period before penalizing the borrower after missing one payment. The period between missing a loan payment and having the loan default is known as delinquency. The delinquency period gives the debtor time to avoid default by contacting their loan servicer or making up missed payments. Defaulting on a loan will cause a substantial and lasting drop in the debtor's credit score, as well as extremely high interest rates on any future loan. For loans secured with collateral, defaulting will likely result in the pledged asset being seized by the bank. The most popular types of consumer loans that are backed by collateral are mortgages, auto loans and secured personal loans. For unsecured debts like credit cards and student loans, the consequences of default vary in severity according to the type of loan. In the most extreme cases, debt collection agencies can garnish wages to pay back the outstanding debt. The loan is one of the most important products of the banking. All the banks are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to apply their loans. However, there are some customers behave negatively after their application are approved.

Conclusion
The last_fico_range, grade, inq_last_6month features were found to be the most relevant for predicting loan default in. The current model tries to predict default biased data from credit analysts grade and assigned interest rate. The XGBC and RF models provide substantial improvements on traditional credit screening. A recall score significantly and robustly above 90%, with AUC-ROC scores ≃74%. The features provided to the model in our study generalize to any lending activity and institution, beyond P2P lending. The present work could, therefore, be augmented in order to predict loan default risk without the need for human credit screening.
Due to the time limit, it is not possible to conduct a thorough study and have a deep understanding of the dataset. There are still many features in the dataset that are unused and a lot of the information has not been fully digested with knowledge in the banking industry.
Only the Random Forest., XGBoost, model is used, but there are many good ones out there even neural networks. The models can also be improved further by finer tunings on hyperparameters or using ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting,.
In the bank loan behaviour prediction, for example, banks want to control the loss to a acceptable level, so they may use a relatively low threshold. This means more customers will be grouped as “potential bad customers” and their profiles will be checked carefully later by the credit risk management team. In this way, banks can detect the default behaviours in the earlier stage and conduct the corresponding actions to reduce the possible loss.
Recomendation
Dataset from a Lending club is an interesting dataset. It is offen very difficult to get the insights of interest rate from Bank. This analysis provides interesting information about the interest rate which we get from Lending club for each person. The interest rate which we receive depends on the various factors like FICO score, Homeownership, Purpose of loan, loan amount requested, Annual income, Employee length, Issue month, Previous bankrupcies and Debt to income ratio. If a person is wanting to get a good interest rate then he need to focus on above factors before applying for a lending club loan. From the research question, we understood that we need to perform various test and add visalizations to understand the patern of Lending club borrowers data and find the interest rate. It is not a very straight forward method which gets from FICO scores. Also lot of financial terms while dealing with loans.
